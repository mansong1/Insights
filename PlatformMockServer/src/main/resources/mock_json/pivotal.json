Following are the use cases for which the approach is needed. \n\nData classification - How do we move data between the buckets configured and what will happen to the relationships during the data movement. \n\nData Search - When data is being searched and if the query involves a timeframe which is spanning across multiple buckets of data how will the query and the service behaves. \n\nSpike should have approach for the following \n\nConfigurations for the data buckets\nWhere and how will the data classification happen and it's impact on relationships between the existing data\nHow the search query work and what are the changes needed at the platform service level.  \n","current_state":"unstarted","requested_by_id":3078412,"url":"https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/159247137","project_id":2182342,"owner_ids":[],"labels":[{"id":20237118,"project_id":2182342,"kind":"label","name":"insights - adoption increase","created_at":"2018-07-05T07:22:51Z","updated_at":"2018-07-05T07:22:51Z"},{"id":20237075,"project_id":2182342,"kind":"label","name":"insights - implementation support","created_at":"2018-07-05T07:10:24Z","updated_at":"2018-07-05T07:10:24Z"}]}],"start":"2019-07-08T07:00:00Z","finish":"2019-07-22T07:00:00Z","kind":"iteration"}]
